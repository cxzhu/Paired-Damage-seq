# Paired-Damage-seq
Single-cell joint analysis of transcriptome with oxidative DNA damage and resulting breaks.

The codes used for analysis of Paired-Damage-seq are summarized into three parts.
- The pre-processing pipeline to extract cell barcodes, map to reference genome, and generate RNA cell-to-gene count matrix.
- The codes for analysis of HeLa Paired-Damage-seq datasets.
- The codes for analysis of mouse brain Paired-Damage-seq datasets.
